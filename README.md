# Git Helper

A really simple plugin that aims to simplify and speed up using Git (and GitHub) in Godot.

Its meant to be used on Linux if you have problems with other Git plugins, but should work on other OSs

## Before you start

- you need to set up your GitHub username and password (use [token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token))
- it's recommended that you set `git config pull.ff only` or your preferred mode
- if you don't have Git installed or you have it at a non-standard location, you should set your Git Path in plugins settings (click on the very bottom right button, next to Enter button)

## Features

- mostly functional git console (only functions that don't require follow up like logging in)
- convenient buttons for quick actions
- buttons that are darker and disabled are not yet functional
